                <h2>Interests</h2>
                <p>I have a strong interest in chemistry and biology and am determined to pursue a career in scientific research in these fields. 
                    Specifically, I am fascinated by studying genetic mechanisms, biochemical reactions at the microscopic level, and the applications of biosynthesis in pharmaceuticals and other areas. 
                    Japan's advanced scientific research in these domains particularly attracts me to pursue higher education there.</p>
                <p>Outside of academics, I enjoy activities such as table tennis, flying drones, and operating remote-controlled model aircraft. 
                    I also have practical skills in website development—this portfolio site was entirely coded and built by myself.</p>

                <h2>Plan</h2>
                <p>My overall plan is to pursue a bachelor's degree at a leading Japanese university, followed by master's and doctoral degrees in a related field. 
                    Ultimately, I aim to engage in scientific research at a university or research institute.</p>
                <p>During my undergraduate studies, I will dedicate myself to mastering all coursework and broadening my academic horizons. 
                    Outside the classroom, I hope to work under the guidance of a supervisor to learn experimental techniques and participate in scientific research projects early on, gaining hands-on laboratory experience.</p>
                <p>Additionally, throughout my time in Japan, I will consistently work on improving my Japanese and English language skills. 
                    Before my undergraduate program formally begins, I also plan to learn essential computer and statistics knowledge, which I believe will be highly beneficial for my future studies and research.</p>
